<p>In IPM, pesticides are used only when needed and in mix with other approaches for more reliable, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the reduction in insecticides, since they work with other pest management techniques, specifically biological control.

<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the way least disruptive to biological control. After dealing with a number of nationwide chain exterminators and being mostly disappointed with the service, I turned to Terminators for help with pest issues at my workplace. The idea of IPM is to keep an eye on and control pests only when they start appearing and removing the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM strategies, Scope of works, application methods and industry particular record keeping procedures.</p>
