<p>In IPM, pesticides are used only when needed and in mix with other approaches for more reliable, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the reduction in insecticides, since they work with other pest management techniques, specifically biological control.

<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the way least disruptive to biological control. After dealing with a number of nationwide chain exterminators and being mostly disappointed with the service, I turned to Terminators for help with pest issues at my workplace.
