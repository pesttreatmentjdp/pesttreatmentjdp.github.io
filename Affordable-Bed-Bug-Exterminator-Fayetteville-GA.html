These unknown or inadequately understood possible risks argue for extra levels of protection consisting of direct exposures to multiple pesticides, in the house, at school and in the diet plan; direct exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial substances and personal care products; and the general problem in attributing persistent illnesses to any one specific cause.</p>
<p>Pest management requires a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after routine tracking indicates that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Many specific commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in limited areas.</p>
