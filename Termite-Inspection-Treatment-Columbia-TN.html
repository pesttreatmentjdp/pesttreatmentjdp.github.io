CHEMICAL CONTROL OF PEST PEST: Use of synthetic chemicals for managing pest population is called chemical control and the chemicals used for this are called insecticides.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied just after routine monitoring suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would surpass the expense of the control procedures.</p>
<p>Identification of the pest, understanding its biology and seasonal population trends, harmful life phases and their environments, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life phase for several control choices, host preference and alternate hosts, predictability of pest incident based on the environment, cropping trends, farming practices, and other influencing aspects, and all the related information is critical for identifying a reliable control method. </p>

This chapter discusses various methods to keep pest insects at bearable levels or to put it simply integrated pest management (IPM). Keep kids and family pets away from locations where pesticides have actually been used.</p>
