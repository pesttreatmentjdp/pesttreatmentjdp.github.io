<p>Objective Statement: The objective of Mosquito Control is to supply Leon County citizens with environmentally sound and effective mosquito control services. Similar to us, pests require food, water, and shelter to make it through, and if they can't find these in your house, it's likely they'll go somewhere else. If they can not enter it, pests can not make it through without food and will not infest a structure. Another method includes utilizing baits that either destroy the pests or avoid them from reproducing. C) Reduction in quantities of production and protection inputs of non-renewable resource origin (generally pesticides) while maintaining stable productivity levels for the region.</p>
