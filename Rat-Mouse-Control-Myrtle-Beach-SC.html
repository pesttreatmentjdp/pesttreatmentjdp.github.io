For instance, host plant resistance is efficiently used in some crops with pest and illness tolerant or resistant varieties, but not in other crops.</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be exploited for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating interruption strategies (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits consisting of dangerous material will draw in and eliminate the pests when dispersed in the field or placed in traps.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and dissuade pest perseverance consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
