<p>Termites are such destructive pests that you want your termite treatment to result in termite extermination. When identification, action, and tracking thresholds indicate that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer reliable or available, IPM programs then assess the correct control method both for effectiveness and risk. The letter of invitation for this plenary address suggested for its title the main style of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Reality".</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest effective dosage when other approaches of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>In addition to treating existing issues, we recognize conditions that draw in termites such as woodpiles and water leaks.

But excess usage of pesticides, resurgence of minor pest, eco-friendly imbalance, residue pesticide in food and ecological contamination. On the other hand, pest control will consist of eliminating bugs, insects, rats, squirrels as required (in as humanely a fashion as possible).</p>
