<p>Although multiple sources specify IPM in different ways, previous models primarily focused on the environmental, and to some degree on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A recent IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) determined an absence of a holistic IPM method that utilizes both conventional and contemporary tools.</p>
