Chemical controls were to be used only after regular tracking suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control measures.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the concept of incorporating using biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides may be more harmful in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these thresholds adjust for modifications in market value, phase of crop growth, expense of pesticides, etc., but in reality most are based on fixed problem or damage levels.</p>
